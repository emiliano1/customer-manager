**BACKEND INSTALLATION**

 To install the backend, you must have Java 8 installed (Check Oracle Website for more information), Gradle and NodeJS with NPM in order to download the project dependencies.

**`Gradle installation:`**

`sudo apt-get install gradle`

After install Gradle, NodeJS and NPM, we need to install some JS libs in order to run the frontend app. 

Enter in the frontend root folder 'src/main/resources/frontend' and apply the commands below:

`npm install`

After install all JS libs, we need to start the backend and frontend:

**`To start the backend run (in backend root folder):`**

`gradle bootRun` 


**`To start the frontend run (in frontend root folder):`**

`ng serve` 


The username/password for login on frontend is user/123456
